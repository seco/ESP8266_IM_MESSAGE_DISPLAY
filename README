1. The project has the main source code files in the 'user' folder

2. 'libs' subfolder within the user folder contains files for my custom libraries. These include
   stuff like specific IC libs, SPI libs etc. they are used as SUBMODULES from sourcetree

3. These libraries (within the libs folder) are PRIMARILY stored and maintained in a Github repository.
   In these main repos I do the code edits, feature addition etc. independent of the cloned copies.
   
4. To be used in a project, the main library set as a SUBMODULE in SOURCETREE in the 'user\libs' folder
   within the project folder
   
   NOTE : DO NOT PUSH ANY PROJECT SPECIFIC CHANGES FROM THESE CLONED REPOS BACK TO THE MAIN LIBRARY REPO.
          IF SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN THE LIBRARY, DO IT IN THE MAIN REPO.
                    
          THIS STRUCTURE ALLOWS ME TO DO ANY PROJECT SPECIFIC CHANGES TO THE LIBRARY WITHOUT
          DISTUBING THE ORIGINAL LIBRARY
          
5. WITH THIS IN PLACE, IF I DO ANY CHANGES TO THE MAIN LIBRARY REPO, FOR THOSE CHANGES TO REFLECT INTO
   THE CLONED ONES, I HAVE TO DO FETCH + PULL IN THE SUBMODULE OF THE LIBRARY IN SOURCETREE
          
5. For this structure to compile, the following were added to Makefile
   
   MODULES	= driver user user/libs/ESP8266_SPI user/libs/MAX7221_7219 
   EXTRA_INCDIR = include $(SDK_BASE)/../extra/include
   EXTRA_INCDIR := $(EXTRA_INCDIR) C:/Espressif/ESP8266_SDK/driver_lib/include/driver
   
   UNDER MODULES VARIABLE OF MAKEFILE I NEED TO LIST THE COMPLETE RELATIVE PATH OF ALL THE SUBFOLDERS WHERE
   ANY OF MY CODE RESIDES.
   
   The last line modifying EXTRA_INCDIR variable lets me refer to code in driver_lib folder of the ESP SDK
   without copying the source/header files from there into my eclipse project folder.
