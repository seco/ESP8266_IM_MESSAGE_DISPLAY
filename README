1. I have hacked the Makefile to allow me to refer
   to source code files outside of the user folder
   in the project workspace.
   
   to do this, created a new makefile target 'copyfiles'
   that coppies these outside source files (c,h) to the
   user folder in project workspace.
   
   then just do 'all' as usual. or do 'rebuild'
   
   rebuild = clean + copyfiles + all
   
   note: clean removes these externally copied source files also
   
2. to also let me edit and view these external source files, I have
   also added (linked) them within my eclipse project. This way i can
   view and edit these files from within eclipse
